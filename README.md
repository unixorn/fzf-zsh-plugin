This ZSH plugin enables using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to search your command history and do file searches.

It will automagically install `fzf` into your home directory if it isn't already there, and bind `^R` to an `fzf`-powered search of your command history.

Created for the [zsh-quickstart-kit](https://github.com/unixorn/zsh-quickstart-kit) to make the default setup have a more 'batteries included' feel.

Yes, there is a plugin baked into [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), this allows easy `fzf` integration for other frameworks and shells, and adds some helper scripts.

Note - while these scripts could all be ZSH functions instead of scripts in the `bin` directory, it uses standalone scripts so that non-ZSH users can also use the repository by adding its `bin` directory to their `$PATH`.

## Installing

You should set this plugin to be last, or near to last in your framework's list of plugins to load. It dynamically generates `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPT` and `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` based on whether it sees things like `rg` and `bat` in your `$PATH`, so it should come after other plugins have had a chance to extend your `$PATH`.

### [Zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom)

Add `zgenom load unixorn/fzf-zsh-plugin` to your `.zshrc` with your other load commands.

### [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

Add `antigen bundle unixorn/fzf-zsh-plugin@main` to your `.zshrc`

☝  **Note** that until <https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen/issues/717> gets fixed in Antigen, it only recognizes plugins in `master` branch. So you need to explicitly specify `@main` here.

### [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)

1. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/unixorn/fzf-zsh-plugin.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/fzf-zsh-plugin`
2. Add **fzf-zsh-plugin** to your plugin list - edit `~.zshrc` and change `plugins=(...)` to `plugins=(... fzf-zsh-plugin)`

### Without using a framework

1. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/unixorn/fzf-zsh-plugin.git`, then add its `bin` directory to your `$PATH`.
2. Add `source /path/to/repository/checkout/fzf-zsh-plugin.plugin.zsh` to your `.zshrc` file.

The scripts in this collection don't actually require you to be using ZSH as your login shell, they're being distributed as an [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)-compatible plugin because it's convenient for me.

### (optional) Install recommended tools

Optionally, to make the most out of `fzf` preview (`?` toggle), install the following tools and enable the advanced preview (see [Customization](#customization) section):
- `eza` - improved file/directory listing,
- `bat` - a `cat` clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration,
- `chafa` - show images (the image quality depends on the terminal emulator you use),
- `exiftool` - also show image metadata,
- `lesspipe.sh`, e.g. `brew install lesspipe` - and other optional tools `lesspipe.sh` relies on. See <https://github.com/wofr06/lesspipe>
  ☝ **Note**: This is not the `lesspipe` already bundled in Ubuntu/Debian but an improved one (while package is called `lesspipe`, the binary is `lesspipe.sh`).

## Customization

You can customize a few features by exporting the following environment variables in your init script (`.zshrc`/`.bashrc` or similar):

| Export variable                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FZF_PREVIEW_ADVANCED` | Use `less` viewer with a pre-processor to display improved previews for a wide range of files (requires you to install at least `eza`, `bat`, `chafa`, `exiftool`; and very recommended `lesspipe.sh` and the tools it uses underneath: `mdcat`, `in2csv`,...). _This is an opt-in feature._ |
| `FZF_PREVIEW_WINDOW`     | Set any value supported by `fzf --preview-window` option, e.g. `right:65%:nohidden` will show the preview by default.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `FZF_PATH`               | Path to install fzf binary and script, e.g. `${HOME}/.config/fzf`.                                                                            |
| `FZF_COLOR_SCHEME`       | Color scheme for fzf, e.g. `--color='hl:148,hl+:154,pointer:032,marker:010,bg+:237,gutter:008'`                                                                            |

### A note on `lessfilter-fzf`

You can also use it as a general `less` preprocessor to extend the `less` capabilities. To do that, place the following in your shell init scripts (`.zshrc`/`.bashrc` or equivalent):

```shell
export LESSOPEN='| lessfilter-fzf %s'
```

Ultimately, `lesspipe.sh` (if present) will still honor your own `lessfilter` if found in your `PATH`, leading to the following execution: `lessfilter-fzf > lesspipe.sh > lessfilter`.
